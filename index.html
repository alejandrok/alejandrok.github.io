								I am a builder, problem solver and innovator at heart. I love uncovering and exploiting patterns in data, particularly in Audio. Above all, I am a strategic, mission-driven hands-on R&D leader who thrives on advancing innovation through AI technologies and products that inspire and elevate human creativity. 
								<p style="text-align: justify;">As <b>Head of AI</b> at <b><a href="http://www.splice.com" target="_blank">Splice</a></b>, I lead the company's <b>AI strategy</b> and <b>R&D division</b>, developing proprietary <b>Machine Learning & Audio</b> technologies, co-driving <b>product vision</b> and <b>ideation</b> for creation tools, while managing a high-performing team of researchers and ML engineers that I built from the ground up. <br>I was the visionary behind products like <i><a href="https://splice.com/blog/alejandro-koretzky-coso-interview/" target="_blank">Create (formerly CoSo)</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/21/splice-sample-store/" target="_blank">Similar Sounds</a>, Search with Sound, Recommended For You</i> and a co-inventor of the underlying technology, backed by multiple patents. <br>I am currently leading major investments in <b>Generative AI</b> to unlock new modalities in audio editing and the future of music creation. As a trusted advisor to the CEO and some Board members, I have played a pivotal role in shaping the company's direction since its relatively early days.
								</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">Before Splice, I was the founder of <b>tuneSplit</b>, a USC Viterbi spinoff startup that developed pioneering <b><a href="https://medium.com/towards-data-science/audio-ai-isolating-vocals-from-stereo-music-using-convolutional-neural-networks-210532383785" target="_blank">real-time, deep learning based audio source separation technology</a></b> (acquired in 2016), followed by building one of the most sophisticated music visualization engines for VR, introduced at Oculus Connect '16. Back in Argentina, I worked as a C/C++ Software Engineer at Motorola, led voice traffic prediction modeling for the <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naranja_X" target="_blank">largest credit card company</a> and co-founded <a href="https://tuquejasuma.com/" target="_blank">tuquejasuma.com</a> (StartupChile '13), today the leading complaint-resolution platform in the country. 
								</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">With a solid foundation in Applied Research & Engineering, my technical expertise spans <b>machine learning, signal processing</b> and <b>software architecture</b>, paired with a strong intuition for Product and <b>human-computer interaction</b>. As a leader, my force-multiplying quality is orchestrating business goals, product vision & strategy, and hands-on technical leadership to create defensible value for businesses and their customers, while fostering a culture of innovation and risk-taking. 
								</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">My work has been featured in leading outlets such as <b>Forbes, Yahoo, TechCrunch</b> and <b>Bloomberg</b>, with extensive recognition in the music and music-tech scenes, including <b>RollingStone, Billboard, DJ Magazine, Music Radar, Music Business Worldwide, Attack Magazine, edm.com, </b>and more. I have been an invited speaker at top institutions, such as <b>Harvard Business School, Stanford University, Berklee College of Music</b>, as well as organizations like <b>AES, SXSW, NAMM and ISMIR</b>.
								</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">I am green card holder under the EB1 category for exceptional abilities in applies sciences and business.

									<h3 style="text-align: left;">Academic background</h3>
								</div>
								<div class="collapsible-content">
									<p style="text-align: justify;">
										I moved to the U.S. as a <b>Fulbright Presidential Fellow</b> from Argentina, with a <b>Dean's Masters Fellowship</b> offer from <b>USC Viterbi</b>, where I earned my M.Sc. in <b>Electrical Engineering</b>, specializing in <b>Multimedia Signal Processing & Machine Learning</b>. I worked with the <i>Digital Signal Processing Lab, Immersive Audio Lab</i> and <i>Media Communications Lab</i>, with advising professors <a href="https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Kuo/Chung-Chieh" target="_blank">-C Jay Kuo</a> and <a href="https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Kyriakakis/Christos" target="_blank">Chris Kyriakakis</a>. As part of my research work —which later became the foundation for tuneSplit—, I built some of the early <b>machine learning models for real time audio deconstruction</b>, receiving incubation by the USC Office of Technology Innovation and Entrepreneurship and selected for an <b>NSF</b> grant. <br><br>In Argentina, I earned my Engineer's Degree (5.5 year program) in <b>Electrical & Telecommunications Engineering</b>, with invited seminars at Technion and Vrije University for my thesis work on traffic prediction modeling and queueing systems. In my fourth year, I received a full scholarship to study <b>Computer Science</b> at the <b>University of Richmond</b>, where I focused on data structures, algorithms and network protocols.

										<br><br>If I ever return to school, I would explore Bioinformatics, Materials Science, or perhaps my first love, Architecture.

								<div class="collapsible-header">
									<h3 style="text-align: left;">Advisory & consulting work</h3>
								</div>
								<div class="collapsible-content">
									<p style="text-align: justify;">
										I believe in giving and helping others pursue bold ideas. I've been an active mentor and advisor to several companies and organizations on technology, product strategy, data, and hiring. I’ve worked with <b>Techstars</b> (Roux Institute ’22, Tel Aviv ’24), StartupWeekend, the USC Startup Garage. I have advised Cornell Tech programs and consulted for YC-backed startups. I occasionally help VCs and small funds with due diligence efforts. One of my most memorable projects was consulting for <a href="https://www.spaceil.com/" target="_blank">SpaceIL</a> as part of the Google Lunar X Prize competition, contributing to their inspiring mission to land the first Israeli spacecraft on the moon. <br><br>Back in Argentina, I'm involved in a few <a href="https://cordobaacelera.com.ar/" target=""_blank> Government-led initiatives</a> to help develop the tech and startups ecosystem. I'm also an advisor at <a href="https://www.anyoneai.com/" target="_blank">Anyone AI.</a>.

								<div class="collapsible-header">
									<h3 style="text-align: left;">Music</h3>
								</div>
								<div class="collapsible-content">
									<p style="text-align: justify;">
										I have a deep connection to music and music culture. I truly believe that music is the universal language and the social glue that keeps us in relative harmony with each other. 
										<br>
										<br>
										While pursuing my engineering degree at USC, I also attended the <b>Thornton School of Music</b>, studying songwriting under Andrea Stolpe and performing & recording with the Thornton Apollo Men's Chorus.
										In Argentina, I was the producer and lead singer of Ximetria, a rock band I founded in 2006 with two studio album releases, music videos on MTV and VH1 Latin America, and a few memorable performances, including Hard Rock Rising Buenos Aires 2012 and the Youbloom Music Awards, London 2012.
										<br>
										<br>I am currently working on my next production project, 'Stolen Signals'. Expect some releases in 2025!
